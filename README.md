## Learning Goals

- Improve your typing speed

## Introduction

Typing speed usually isn't what limits your productivity as a developer. Usually focusing on the right problems to solve and having strategic debugging and problem solving processes almost always trump getting around your computer quickly. Nevertheless, as a developer, you'll type a lot. You should get good at it.

There are a few different online resources for improving your touch typing. You should find one that you like and will use, and then commit to spending some regular time practicing. [Typing Club](https://www.typingclub.com/) is an excellent key-by-key touch typing learning platform. While it can sometimes be weird or frustrating to type random strings of letters, it does offer instructions to help build good habits and teach you where your fingers ought to go in order to dramatically increase your WPMs.

Learning Tips:

- At first, aim for precision and correctness, not speed. Speed comes later, after you stop making mistakes.
- Learn the home row. Put your fingers on the right keys. Use the right fingers to reach the keys.
- Avoid looking at the keyboard. Forcing your fingers to remember where the keys are is difficult at first, but you can do it!

> Note: As a programmer, you end up using a lot of the 'weirder' keys on the keyboard. That means you should focus on the numbers, punctuation, and special characters.

There is no 'right' goal to aim for in terms of WPMs, but the internet suggests that 40-50 wpms is a decent standard to shoot for. If you're hovering below 30, it's probably worth a few hours of practice now, to save you hundreds of hours over the next few years.

> Note: As a programmer, you will end up typing in tools that support autocomplete, history, and powerful editing techniques (multicursor, global find / replace, regex matching). You should learn how to be effective in your tools, not just at typing in general.
